# PasswordCracker
## About
This is a project I did for my securities class. It is a hashed password cracker. It uses a dictionary to store the hashes. When it is run, it populates the dictionary which takes a large portion of the runtime, and then compares the list of passwords the user put in to the hashes in the dictionary.
